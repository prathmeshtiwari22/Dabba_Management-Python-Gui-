## Introduction

The Dabba Management Python project is a Python-based application that simplifies the process of managing food and drink orders. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter for a user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Order Management:** Users can select a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, along with drinks and cocktails, to create their orders.

- **Cost Calculation:** The program calculates the total cost of the order based on the selected items and their quantities.

- **Receipt Generation:** Users can generate a receipt with a breakdown of the order details for reference or printing.

## Requirements

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

- Tkinter: Tkinter is included with most Python installations and should be available for creating the GUI.

- No additional libraries are required.
